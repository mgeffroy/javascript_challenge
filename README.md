JavaScript and DOM Manipulation
## Information 
Javascript Homework for the Data Analysis Bootcamp. In this challenge UFO sightings information was put in a webpage. It can be filtered depending on the date the UFO was seen. 
This repository contains the code for the creation of two different webpage files called ***UFO-level-1*** and ***UFO-level-2***. At first they might look like the same thing but one has more filters than the other.
